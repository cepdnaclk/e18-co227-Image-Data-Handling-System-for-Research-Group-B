## Introduction

In this project, we develop a mobile application that can be used to capture and upload images of the oral cavity. This will mainly serve the roles of the admin to accept user requests and the doctor to capture the oral cavity images and upload them along with the patient's details. 

### Purpose of Our Project

This is a support system for the project of building an AI-based web application for Oral Cavity Detection which is done by a team of E17 undergraduates.
An AI-based tool needs a lot of images to train the model. But, A web-based application doesn't provide a convenient method for the doctors to capture the photographs of the oral cavities and upload them forthwith. This mobile application will be a solution to the aforementioned issue.
